# How to Extract 3D Photos from Video with the App

Follow these steps using key commands to manually extract and save left and right image pairs from a video file. The steps assume
the video trucks from left to right. The "H" key toggle displays the current command key summary.

1. Select an input video file with the "I" key command. 
Select an output folder for saving images extracted from frames with the "O" key command.

2. Start by selecting the left eye frame. You can use the Enter key to preview the video in slow motion. 
Pressing Enter again stops the video. The "Z" key rewinds the video. 
Use the space key to advance a single frame in the video file. 
The backspace key displays the previous frame. Use the "tab" key to advance 10 video frames.

3. Having selected a left eye frame, place your mouse cursor over a feature point in the frame where the stereo window will be placed.
This point will also be used to align the frames vertically. Features in foreground and in front of the stereo window will pop out.
Click the mouse button to show crosshairs marking this position. Press the "G" key to save this fixed feature position for later alignment.
A large crosshair will mark this position.
Press the "L" key to label the frame as a left eye view, 
Press "S" key to save the frame in the output folder.
Note: Subjects behind the stereo window have positive parallax, subjects in front of the window have negative parallax.

4. Now advance video frames (space bar) to find a suitable right eye view frame. The crosshair spacing is a percentage of the display window width.
The frame used should be less than 3% of the window width. 
After selecting the right eye frame, use the right arrow key to move the frame so that the two vertical crosshair patterns match.
Press the "R" key to label the frame as right eye. Now if the feature position does not line up vertically with the feature crosshair, use the
up/down arrow keys to position the horizontal crosshairs on the same plane. Press the "S" key to save the right eye frame in the output folder. 

5. Check how the selected left and right views look in stereo by pressing the "A" key to convert to Anaglyph view. 
Use Red-Cyan glasses to see the stereoscopic effect.
If satisfied, save the anaglyph image with the "S" key.
If not satisifed, press the "A" key again to exit anaglyph mode, adjust the position of the alignment with the arrow keys. 
Or start over and select new left and right views. 
If you change the frame used for the left view you must press the "G" key again to save the large window crosshair position that 
defines the placement of the stero window.

6. Press the "+" key to increment the group number for saving extracted photos in a new photo group.

7. The "K" key will save the selected frame in its original video resolution, without any alignment adjustments.
These files can be aligned with Stereo Photo Maker.
