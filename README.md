# Extract-3D-Photo-From-Video
 This processing.org Java application assists with left and right eye image pair extraction for creating 3D/4V stereo photos from motion videos that truck left to right.
 
Single key commands that control the app are defined in help.txt.

Mouse press displays crosshairs for setting the stereo window. 

## Building 
When you build Extract 3D Photo for Windows or Linux (version 3.5.4), you must add the SelectFile to the Processing SDK. See [Processing Library](https://processing.org/reference/libraries/) information under Contributions.
